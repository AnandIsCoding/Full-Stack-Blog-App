The line app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); is middleware that helps Express parse incoming request data sent in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format, such as data from HTML forms. It decodes the data and populates the req.body object, allowing you to access submitted form values in your Express routes.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Parses URL-encoded Data: When you send form data via an HTML form using the POST method (without explicitly setting enctype="multipart/form-data"), the data is encoded in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. Express cannot read this data by default, so express.urlencoded() parses it and adds it to req.body.

extended: true Option:

Setting { extended: true } allows for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format, using the qs library.
If you set { extended: false }, it uses the querystring library, which can only handle simple key-value pairs (i.e., no nested objects).
How It Works in Practice: With express.urlencoded({ extended: true }), you can send form data that includes arrays, nested objects, and other complex structures.
